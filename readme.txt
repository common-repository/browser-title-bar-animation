== Description ==

**Don't lose visitors. Catch the user's attention using Title Bar Animation.**

Grab the users' attention and take them back to your shop/website and reduce site abandonment.

Even though it is small animation applied to the title bar, this plugin nearly **98% succeeds in drawing the attention** of the users and taking them back to your shop/website.

We have noticed that many users open several tabs within the same browser to get more information about the site, products, etc. Usually, a user opens a lot of browser tabs to check other websites, coupons for a product, product reviews, etc. This kind of distractions often causes the site abandonment.

To stand out from such kind of distractions, We have created **Browser Title Bar Animation** plugin to help every website owner to catch users' attention and take them back to your shop/site.

Title bar animation will grab the user's attention and try to take them back to your store/website.
